# Mushroom-Classification
This project was created as part of the ***Foundations of AI*** course. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their characteristics.

I used several different methods to create and train models for this classification task, including: **Sequential Model, Linear Model with Lasso, Decision Tree Classifier,SVM**

Data set is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification)
